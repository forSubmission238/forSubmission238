The Isabelle code contains the formal proofs mentioned in the paper. To check the proofs, please use a recent version of Isabelle 
(Isabellehttps://isabelle.in.tum.de) to open the files, Isabelle will automatically start to check the proofs. As long as the code 
does not contain unfinished parts (marked by “sorry”) and the check does not produce errors (marked by red lines), the proofs
 are correct according to the Isabelle kernel.
